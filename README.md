# MEMORY GAME
A simple and fun way to learn the DOM?
Creating a memory game all using the DOM manipulation with JS :)
## Description
This is the classic memory game that we are used to play as kids, but is a very enjoiable project to learn the DOM concepts in front-end.
Here I have covered most of the main things of it, from the creation of a grid, to adding some data to it and some functions to reconize the moves of the player.
